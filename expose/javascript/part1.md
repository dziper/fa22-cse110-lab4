1. `values added:  20`
2. `final result:  20`

3. `values added:  20`
4. The code returns an error, saying `result` is undefined. This is because it's declared using `let` so it goes out of scope after the if statement.

5. The code returns an error when assigning `result = num1 + num2`, because `result` is a `const` variable and thus cannot be changed.
6. There was an error before this line, it was not executed.
